# Atelier Companion

A simple web app to convert images and Photoshop documents into SPD files for the Atelier app on your Supernote device.

## What is Atelier Companion for?

Atelier Companion makes it easy for anyone—no software installs or technical setup required—to turn pictures or PSD (Photoshop) files into the SPD format that Atelier on Supernote uses.

## What’s new compared to the original Atelier-parser?

- runs entirely in your web browser (Windows, Mac, Linux, Chromebook, Android or iPad)  
- no downloads or installs—just open the page and go  
- supports images up to 6000 × 6000 pixels  
- lets you import one or more images or an entire PSD with layers  
- add simple layer adjustments (rotate, flip, rearrange) before export  
- faster processing and cleaner output files  

## How to get started

1. Open any web browser and go to  
   https://ziv-ink.github.io/Atelier-Companion  
2. Click **Import** and select one or more image files (jpg, png, etc.) or a PSD file  
3. Use the on-screen controls to:  
   - rotate layers  
   - flip layers  
   - drag layers into the order you want  
4. When you’re ready, click **Export SPD**  
5. Copy the downloaded `.spd` file to your Supernote  
6. Open Atelier on your Supernote and load your new file  

## Tips for smooth use

- larger images may take a few seconds to load  
- make sure your PSD files use standard Photoshop layer naming (text layers will flatten)  
- you can repeat import-export as often as you like without reloading the page
